## Getting Started

The Healthy Productivity Bot is built to help individuals boost their productivity while prioritizing their health and wellbeing. By analyzing user activity and utilizing a neural network model with memory, the bot assists in suggesting tasks and creating an optimized schedule tailored to each user's needs.

## Features

1. Task Suggestion: The bot uses the LSTM model to suggest tasks based on previous user activity and personal preferences. These suggestions align with the user's goals, helping them focus on productive and healthy tasks.
2. Task Planning: Users have the option to let the bot automatically plan out their daily, weekly, or even monthly tasks. The bot considers priority, time required, and other factors to create an efficient and well-balanced schedule.
3. Optimal Schedule Creation: By leveraging the neural network model, the bot generates an optimal schedule that balances work, breaks, exercise, and other activities. This ensures users maintain a healthy work-life balance and make the most of their time.
4. Personalization: The bot takes into account user preferences and learns from previous interactions to provide tailored suggestions and scheduling. Over time, it optimizes its recommendations, making the user experience more relevant and effective.
